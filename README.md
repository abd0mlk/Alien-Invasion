# Alien Invasion

## Description

Hey there people!
This is my very first project, so it most probably won't be perfect.

If you do play this game. Well, first of all, thank you. Additionally, feedback
would be much appreciated.
You can contact me via the methods listed in my profile.

A brief description of the general gameplay is given below.

### General Gameplay

In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom
center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left using the
arrow keys and fire bullets using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet
of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots
and destroys the aliens. If the player destroys all the aliens, a new fleet
appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the
player's ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship.
If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
